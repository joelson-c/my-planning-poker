# Planning Poker Estimation System

## Overview

This repository contains a Planning Poker Estimation System, a collaborative tool designed for agile development teams to streamline the estimation process. The system utilizes Docker Compose to manage both development and production environments. Two Docker Compose files are included:

-   **docker-compose.yml:** Configures development containers.
-   **docker-compose.production.yml:** Configures production containers using Dockerfiles to maintain isolation.

## Development Workflow
